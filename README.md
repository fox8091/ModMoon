# I was led to this page by ModMoon with some weird error about a cartridge...?
This was an error in previous versions of ModMoon, however, it has been fixed as of the latest version. If you're on the latest version already, either delete the config file at `/3ds/ModMoon/settings.txt` or, if you'd prefer to keep your existing settings, enable the [EnableFlexibleCartridgeSystem](https://github.com/Swiftloke/ModMoon/blob/master/source/config.cpp#L109) config in ModMoon's config file.
